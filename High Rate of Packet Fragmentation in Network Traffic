High Rate of Packet Fragmentation in Network Traffic

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Discovery (TA0007)
Technique: Network Service Scanning (T1046)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for fragmented packets.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where PacketFragmented == true
| summarize FragmentedPacketCount = count() by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, FragmentedPacketCount

Testing:
Use tools like hping3 to generate fragmented packets.
