Excessive Changes to Monitoring Thresholds

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
Technique: Impair Defenses (T1562)

Detection Logic:
Monitor logs for repeated changes to alert thresholds in monitoring systems.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:

AuditLogs
| where OperationName == "UpdateAlertThreshold"
| summarize ThresholdChangeCount = count() by InitiatedBy, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ThresholdChangeCount > 3 // Adjust based on environment
| project TimeGenerated, InitiatedBy, ThresholdChangeCount

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Adjust monitoring thresholds in a test system and validate detection.
