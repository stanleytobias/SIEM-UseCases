Brute Force Attacks

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006)

MITRE Techniques:
Brute Force (T1110): Repeated login attempts to guess credentials.

Detection Logic:
Monitor authentication logs for repeated failed login attempts followed by a success.
Alert on login attempts from unknown or flagged IPs.
Correlate with geolocation or time-based anomalies.

MS Sentinel:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625 // Failed login attempts
| summarize FailedLoginAttempts = count() by AccountName, SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailedLoginAttempts > 10 // Adjust threshold for brute force
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, SourceIP, FailedLoginAttempts

AuthenticationLogs
| where ResultType == "Failure"
| summarize FailureCount = count() by UserPrincipalName, SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailureCount > 20 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, SourceIP, FailureCount
