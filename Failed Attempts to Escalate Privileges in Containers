Failed Attempts to Escalate Privileges in Containers

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Privilege Escalation (TA0004)
Technique: Container Escaping (T1611)

Detection Logic:
Monitor container logs for failed privilege escalation attempts.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
ContainerLogs
| where LogMessage contains "permission denied"
| summarize EscalationAttempts = count() by ContainerName, User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where EscalationAttempts > 3
| project TimeGenerated, ContainerName, User, EscalationAttempts

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Attempt to execute privileged commands within a container.
