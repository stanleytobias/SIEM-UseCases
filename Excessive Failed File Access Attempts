Excessive Failed File Access Attempts

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Brute Force (T1110)

Detection Logic:
Detect repeated failed attempts to access files.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileAuditLogs
| where ActionType == "FailedAccess"
| summarize FailedAccessCount = count() by User, FilePath, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailedAccessCount > 10 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, FilePath, FailedAccessCount

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Attempt to access restricted files from a non-privileged account.
