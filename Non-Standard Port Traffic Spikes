Non-Standard Port Traffic Spikes

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Non-Standard Port Traffic (T1571): Traffic on uncommon ports may indicate malicious communication.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for traffic spikes on non-standard or rarely used ports.
Correlate with DNS and endpoint logs to identify the source of the traffic.
Alert on non-standard port usage associated with flagged IPs or domains.

MS Sentinel:
NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationPort !in (80, 443, 22, 3389) // Exclude common ports
| summarize TrafficVolume = sum(BytesSent + BytesReceived) by DestinationPort, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TrafficVolume > 100000000 // Adjust threshold for spikes (in bytes)
| project TimeGenerated, DestinationPort, TrafficVolume
