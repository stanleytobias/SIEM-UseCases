Non-Standard Port Traffic Spikes

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Non-Standard Port Traffic (T1571): Traffic on uncommon ports may indicate malicious communication.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for traffic spikes on non-standard or rarely used ports.
Correlate with DNS and endpoint logs to identify the source of the traffic.
Alert on non-standard port usage associated with flagged IPs or domains.
