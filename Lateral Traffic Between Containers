Lateral Traffic Between Containers

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Lateral Movement (TA0008)
Technique: Exploitation for Lateral Movement (T1210)

Detection Logic:
Detect high volumes of traffic between containers.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
ContainerNetworkLogs
| summarize TrafficVolume = sum(BytesTransferred) by SourceContainer, DestinationContainer, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TrafficVolume > 1000000 // Adjust threshold in bytes
| project TimeGenerated, SourceContainer, DestinationContainer, TrafficVolume

Testing:
Simulate communication between test containers.
