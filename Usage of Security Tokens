Usage of Security Tokens

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Abuse of Authentication Tokens (T1550): Security tokens used in unusual ways could signal compromise.
Valid Accounts (T1078): Unauthorized token use for privileged access.

Detection Logic:
Track token usage logs and alert on tokens used by unauthorized accounts or systems.
Correlate token use with geolocations or times inconsistent with baseline behavior.
Detect reuse of expired or compromised tokens.

MS Sentinel:
AuthenticationLogs
| where AuthenticationMethod == "TokenBased"
| summarize TokenUsageCount = count() by User, TokenID, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TokenUsageCount > 10 // Adjust threshold for abnormal usage
| project TimeGenerated, User, TokenID, TokenUsageCount
