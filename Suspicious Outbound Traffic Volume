Suspicious Outbound Traffic Volume

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Exfiltration Over Network Medium (T1048)

Detection Logic:
Detect abnormally high outbound traffic from a single host.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| summarize OutboundTraffic = sum(BytesTransferred) by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where OutboundTraffic > 1000000000 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, OutboundTraffic

Testing:
Simulate large outbound data transfers using test tools like scp or rsync.
