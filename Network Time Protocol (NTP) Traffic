Network Time Protocol (NTP) Traffic

MITRE Tactic:
Defense Evasion (TA0005) / Command and Control (TA0011)

MITRE Techniques:
Protocol Tunneling (T1572): NTP traffic could be used for covert communication.
Fallback Channels (T1008): NTP may serve as a fallback C2 channel.

Detection Logic:
Monitor network traffic for unusual NTP requests, especially to non-standard servers.
Detect spikes in NTP traffic volume or requests to known malicious IPs.
Alert on abnormal packet sizes or frequency in NTP communication.

MS Sentinel:
NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationPort == 123 and Protocol == "UDP"
| summarize NTPRequestCount = count() by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where NTPRequestCount > 100 // Define abnormal threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, NTPRequestCount
