Network Time Protocol (NTP) Traffic

MITRE Tactic:
Defense Evasion (TA0005) / Command and Control (TA0011)

MITRE Techniques:
Protocol Tunneling (T1572): NTP traffic could be used for covert communication.
Fallback Channels (T1008): NTP may serve as a fallback C2 channel.

Detection Logic:
Monitor network traffic for unusual NTP requests, especially to non-standard servers.
Detect spikes in NTP traffic volume or requests to known malicious IPs.
Alert on abnormal packet sizes or frequency in NTP communication.
