Data Access Spikes

MITRE Tactic:
Collection (TA0009)

MITRE Techniques:
Data from Network Shared Drive (T1039): Spikes in data access could signal data collection for exfiltration.

Detection Logic:
Monitor file access logs for rapid spikes in read or copy operations.
Alert on access to sensitive or high-value files by unauthorized users.
Correlate with user behavior, such as privilege escalation or geolocation anomalies.

MS Sentinel:
FileAccessLogs
| summarize AccessCount = count() by User, FilePath, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where AccessCount > 100 // Adjust based on baseline
| project TimeGenerated, User, FilePath, AccessCount
