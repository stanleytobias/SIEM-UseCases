Repeated Attempts to Restart Security Services

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
Technique: Disable or Modify Tools (T1562.001)

Detection Logic:
Monitor logs for repeated service start events targeting security services.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
ServiceControlLogs
| where ServiceName contains "Security" and ActionType == "Start"
| summarize RestartCount = count() by ServiceName, AccountName, bin(TimeGenerated, 10m)
| where RestartCount > 3 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, ServiceName, AccountName, RestartCount

Testing:
Repeatedly attempt to restart a security service in a test environment.
