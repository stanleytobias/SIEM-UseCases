File Activity involving steganography

MITRE Tactic:
Exfiltration (TA0010) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Exfiltration Over Steganography (T1001.002): Using steganographic techniques to hide malicious data in files.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for files with unusual metadata or high entropy (indicative of hidden data).
Detect large image or multimedia files being uploaded or downloaded outside normal baselines.
Correlate file activity with user behavior, focusing on anomalies in file creation or access.
