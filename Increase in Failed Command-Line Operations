Increase in Failed Command-Line Operations

MITRE Tactic:
Execution (TA0002) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Command-Line Interface (T1059): Repeated failed operations may indicate unauthorized or exploratory activity.
Execution Guardrails (T1480): Failed attempts could result from bypass failures.

Detection Logic:
Track command-line execution logs for repeated failures within a short period.
Correlate with unusual user behavior or access attempts.
Alert on command-line usage with common errors like "command not found" or syntax errors.

MS Sentinel:
CommandExecutionLogs
| where Status == "Failed"
| summarize FailedCommandCount = count() by User, ProcessName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailedCommandCount > 20 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, ProcessName, FailedCommandCount
