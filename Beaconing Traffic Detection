Beaconing Traffic Detection

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011)

MITRE Techniques:
C2 Communication over Web Protocols (T1071.001): Beaconing patterns can indicate C2 traffic.

Detection Logic:
Analyze outbound traffic for regular intervals or repeated connections to the same IPs/domains.
Use anomaly detection to identify deviations in traffic volume or frequency.
Correlate with threat intelligence feeds to flag known C2 domains or IPs.
