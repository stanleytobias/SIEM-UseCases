Unexpected Use of IPv6 in IPv4 Networks

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
Technique: Protocol Tunneling (T1572)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for IPv6 traffic in networks predominantly using IPv4.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol == "IPv6" and SourceIP !startswith "2001:"
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, Protocol

Testing:
Send IPv6 packets in an IPv4-only network.
