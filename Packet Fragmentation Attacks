Packet Fragmentation Attacks

MITRE Tactic:
Defense Evasion (TA0005) / Initial Access (TA0001)

MITRE Techniques:
Network Traffic Obfuscation (T1027): Fragmented packets can evade firewalls or IDS/IPS systems.

Detection Logic:
Monitor network traffic for an unusually high number of fragmented packets.
Alert on fragmented packets targeting sensitive systems or services.
Correlate with endpoint logs for processes generating such traffic.
