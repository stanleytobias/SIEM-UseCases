Packet Fragmentation Attacks

MITRE Tactic:
Defense Evasion (TA0005) / Initial Access (TA0001)

MITRE Techniques:
Network Traffic Obfuscation (T1027): Fragmented packets can evade firewalls or IDS/IPS systems.

Detection Logic:
Monitor network traffic for an unusually high number of fragmented packets.
Alert on fragmented packets targeting sensitive systems or services.
Correlate with endpoint logs for processes generating such traffic.

MS Sentinel:
NetworkTraffic
| where PacketSize < 500 // Adjust based on expected minimum size
| summarize FragmentedPacketCount = count() by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FragmentedPacketCount > 50 // Adjust threshold for fragmentation
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, FragmentedPacketCount
