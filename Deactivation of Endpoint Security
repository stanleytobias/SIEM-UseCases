Deactivation of Endpoint Security

MITRE Tactic:
Defense Evasion (TA0005) / Impact (TA0040)

MITRE Techniques:
Disabling Security Tools (T1562.001): Attempted deactivation of endpoint security to avoid detection.

Detection Logic:
Monitor endpoint logs for changes to antivirus or EDR configurations.
Alert on process termination attempts targeting security tools.
Detect uninstallation commands issued for endpoint protection software.

MS Sentinel:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID in (7036, 7045) // Service state changes or uninstallation
| where ServiceName contains "Antivirus" or ServiceName contains "EDR"
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, ServiceName, EventDescription
