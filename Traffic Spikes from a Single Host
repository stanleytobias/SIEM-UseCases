Traffic Spikes from a Single Host

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Data Exfiltration Over Network Medium (T1048): Unusual spikes may indicate exfiltration attempts.
Beaconing (T1071): Large amounts of data or frequent connections to a C2 server.

Detection Logic:
Monitor traffic volume per host over time and alert on significant spikes.
Correlate spikes with unusual destinations or non-standard ports.
Compare against normal usage patterns for the specific host.

MS Sentinel:
NetworkTraffic
| summarize TrafficVolume = sum(BytesSent + BytesReceived) by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TrafficVolume > 1000000000 // Adjust threshold for spikes
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, TrafficVolume
