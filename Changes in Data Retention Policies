Changes in Data Retention Policies

MITRE Tactic:
Impact (TA0040) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Data Destruction (T1485): Changes in retention policies might facilitate data deletion to cover tracks.
Impair Defenses (T1562): Modifying retention policies to evade detection or audits.

Detection Logic:
Track changes to data retention policies in audit logs.
Compare against a baseline of typical policy update frequency and authorized accounts.
Alert on changes made by unauthorized or unusual accounts.

MS Sentinel:
AuditLogs
| where OperationName == "ModifyRetentionPolicy"
| summarize ChangeCount = count() by InitiatedBy, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ChangeCount > 1 // Adjust based on expected frequency
| project TimeGenerated, InitiatedBy, ChangeCount
