Ransomware Activity Detection

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for unusual file extension changes and high file encryption rates.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileAuditLogs
| where FileExtension in (".encrypted", ".lock", ".crypto")
| summarize EncryptionActivity = count() by FilePath, User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, FilePath, User, EncryptionActivity

Testing:
Execute a benign ransomware simulation tool in a test environment.
