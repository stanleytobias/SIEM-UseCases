Anomalous Behavior of Printer Devices

MITRE Tactic:
Impact (TA0040) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Network Device Discovery (T1120): Anomalous printer behavior may indicate network reconnaissance.
Data Destruction (T1485): Misuse of printers to disrupt operations or destroy data.

Detection Logic:
Monitor network traffic from printers for unusual patterns (e.g., data spikes, non-standard ports).
Alert on unauthorized printer configurations or firmware updates.
Detect print jobs with suspicious content (e.g., mass printing of sensitive files).

MS Sentinel:
PrintLogs
| summarize PrintJobCount = count() by PrinterName, User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where PrintJobCount > 50 // Define threshold for anomalous printing
| project TimeGenerated, PrinterName, User, PrintJobCount
