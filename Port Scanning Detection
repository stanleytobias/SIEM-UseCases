Port Scanning Detection

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Discovery (TA0007)
Technique: Network Service Scanning (T1046)

Detection Logic:
Identify scans based on patterns such as sequential port access.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| summarize ScannedPorts = dcount(DestinationPort) by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ScannedPorts > 20 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, ScannedPorts

Testing:
Perform a comprehensive port scan using tools like nmap or hping.
