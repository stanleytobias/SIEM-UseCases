Suspicious Traffic Between VLANs

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Lateral Movement (TA0008)
Technique: Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210)

Detection Logic:
Detect unusual traffic between VLANs, such as high bandwidth or unauthorized access.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where SourceVLAN != DestinationVLAN
| summarize TrafficVolume = sum(BytesTransferred) by SourceVLAN, DestinationVLAN, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TrafficVolume > 100000000 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceVLAN, DestinationVLAN, TrafficVolume

Testing:
Generate inter-VLAN traffic using test systems.
