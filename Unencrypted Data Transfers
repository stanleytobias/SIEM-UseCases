Unencrypted Data Transfers

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Exfiltration Over Unencrypted/Obfuscated Channels (T1048.001)

Detection Logic:
Monitor data transfers over unencrypted channels (e.g., HTTP).

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol == "HTTP" and DestinationPort != 443
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, BytesTransferred

Testing:
Transfer data using an unencrypted HTTP channel in a test environment.
