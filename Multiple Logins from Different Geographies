Multiple Logins from Different Geographies

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Valid Accounts (T1078)

Detection Logic:
Detect logins from different geolocations for the same user within a short time.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
AuthenticationLogs
| extend GeoLocation = GetGeoLocation(ClientIP)
| summarize GeoCount = dcount(GeoLocation.Country) by UserPrincipalName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where GeoCount > 1
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, GeoCount

Testing:
Simulate logins from different regions using a VPN.
