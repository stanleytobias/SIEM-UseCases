USB Device Usage Anomalies

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Collection (TA0009)
Technique: Data from Removable Media (T1025)

Detection Logic:
Detect unusual USB device connections or high-frequency usage.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
USBDeviceLogs
| summarize DeviceUsage = count() by DeviceID, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where DeviceUsage > 10
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceID, DeviceUsage

Testing:
Connect multiple USB devices to a system within a short period.
