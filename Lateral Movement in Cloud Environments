Lateral Movement in Cloud Environments

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Lateral Movement (TA0008)
Technique: Exploitation of Cloud Compute Infrastructure (T1578)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for unusual API calls or access patterns in cloud environments.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
AzureActivity
| where OperationName contains "Access"
| summarize AccessCount = count() by ResourceId, Caller, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where AccessCount > 5 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, ResourceId, Caller, AccessCount

Testing:
Use test credentials to access multiple cloud resources.
