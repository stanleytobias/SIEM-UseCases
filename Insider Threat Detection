Insider Threat Detection

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Data Transfer to Cloud Accounts (T1567.002)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for unusual activities, such as accessing sensitive files outside working hours.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileAuditLogs
| where AccessTime outside (datetime(09:00:00) .. datetime(17:00:00))
| summarize AccessCount = count() by User, FilePath, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where AccessCount > 20 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, FilePath, AccessCount

Testing:
Access sensitive files during off-hours from a monitored account.
