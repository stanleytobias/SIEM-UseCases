Cloud Resource Sharing Violations

MITRE Tactic:
Collection (TA0009) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Data Transfer to Cloud Accounts (T1567.002): Unauthorized sharing may indicate data exfiltration.

Detection Logic:
Monitor cloud storage sharing logs for files shared with external accounts or public links.
Alert on sharing permissions being changed to "everyone" or "public."
Correlate with user behavior to detect unauthorized sharing patterns.
