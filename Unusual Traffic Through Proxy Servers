Unusual Traffic Through Proxy Servers

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
Technique: Use Alternate Authentication Material (T1550.003)

Detection Logic:
Detect abnormal traffic through proxy servers, such as high volume or uncommon destinations.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
ProxyLogs
| summarize TotalBytes = sum(BytesTransferred) by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TotalBytes > 100000000
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, TotalBytes

Testing:
Generate high traffic through a proxy in a controlled environment.
