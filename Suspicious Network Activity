Suspicious Network Activity

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Application Layer Protocol (T1071)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for unusual traffic patterns, such as spikes or connections to suspicious IPs.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| summarize TrafficVolume = sum(BytesTransferred) by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TrafficVolume > 100000000 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, TrafficVolume

Testing:
Simulate high network traffic using tools like iperf or hping3.
