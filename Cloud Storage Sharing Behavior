Cloud Storage Sharing Behavior

MITRE Tactic:
Collection (TA0009) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Data Transfer to Cloud Accounts (T1567.002): Suspicious sharing or transfer of data.
Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567.001): Misusing sharing features for exfiltration.

Detection Logic:
Track sharing activity in cloud storage audit logs.
Alert on public sharing of sensitive files or unusually high sharing volumes.
Monitor file access permissions and detect sudden changes to "everyone" or external domains.
