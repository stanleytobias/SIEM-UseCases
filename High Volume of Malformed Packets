High Volume of Malformed Packets

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Network Denial of Service (T1498)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for malformed packets in network traffic.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where PacketValidity == "Malformed"
| summarize MalformedPacketCount = count() by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where MalformedPacketCount > 100 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, MalformedPacketCount

Testing:
Use tools like scapy to craft and send malformed packets.
