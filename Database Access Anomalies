Database Access Anomalies

MITRE Tactic:
Discovery (TA0007) / Collection (TA0009)

MITRE Techniques:
Database Access (T1552.004): Anomalies in database access patterns may indicate unauthorized activity.

Detection Logic:
Monitor database logs for unusual query patterns, such as excessive SELECT or DROP statements.
Alert on access to sensitive tables or data by non-administrative accounts.
Correlate anomalies with user activity logs for unauthorized behavior.

MS Sentinel:
DatabaseAuditLogs
| where ActionType in ("SELECT", "DROP", "DELETE")
| summarize ActionCount = count() by User, DatabaseName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ActionCount > 50 // Define threshold for anomalies
| project TimeGenerated, User, DatabaseName, ActionCount
