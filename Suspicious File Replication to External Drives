Suspicious File Replication to External Drives

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Exfiltration Over Physical Medium (T1052)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for file copy operations to removable storage devices.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileAuditLogs
| where TargetDeviceType == "RemovableMedia"
| summarize FileReplicationCount = count() by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FileReplicationCount > 50 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, FileReplicationCount

Testing:
Copy multiple files to a USB drive on a test machine.
