Use of Debug Privileges

MITRE Tactic:
Privilege Escalation (TA0004) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1548): Abnormal debug privilege usage could signal privilege escalation attempts.

Detection Logic:
Monitor system audit logs for processes started with debug privileges.
Alert on debug privilege usage by unauthorized or non-administrative accounts.
Correlate with abnormal process execution or system changes.

MS Sentinel:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4673 // Privileged service operation
| where PrivilegeList contains "SeDebugPrivilege"
| summarize PrivilegeUseCount = count() by AccountName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, PrivilegeUseCount
