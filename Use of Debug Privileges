Use of Debug Privileges

MITRE Tactic:
Privilege Escalation (TA0004) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1548): Abnormal debug privilege usage could signal privilege escalation attempts.

Detection Logic:
Monitor system audit logs for processes started with debug privileges.
Alert on debug privilege usage by unauthorized or non-administrative accounts.
Correlate with abnormal process execution or system changes.
