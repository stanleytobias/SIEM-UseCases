Traffic Patterns Resembling Covert Channels

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Application Layer Protocol (T1071)

Detection Logic:
Detect traffic patterns such as small, consistent packet sizes or timed intervals.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where BytesTransferred < 100 and TimeBetweenPackets < 1s
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, BytesTransferred

Testing:
Simulate covert channel traffic using tools like ptunnel.
