Default or Weak Credentials

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006)

MITRE Techniques:
Default Credentials (T1078.001): Exploitation of accounts with default or weak passwords.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for login attempts using common username/password combinations (e.g., admin/admin).
Alert on successful logins to sensitive systems with default credentials.
Correlate with vulnerability management scans for misconfigured systems.

MS Sentinel:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625 // Failed login attempts
| where AccountName has_any ("admin", "administrator", "guest")
| summarize FailedAttempts = count() by AccountName, SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, SourceIP, FailedAttempts
