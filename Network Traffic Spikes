Network Traffic Spikes

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Network Denial of Service (T1498)

Detection Logic:
Detect sudden increases in network traffic volume.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| summarize TotalTraffic = sum(BytesTransferred) by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1m)
| where TotalTraffic > 100000000 // Adjust threshold in bytes
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, TotalTraffic

Testing:
Use a traffic generator tool to simulate high network traffic from a test system.
