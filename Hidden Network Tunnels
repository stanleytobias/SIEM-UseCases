Hidden Network Tunnels

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Protocol Tunneling (T1572): Hidden tunnels can be used for C2 traffic or data exfiltration.

Detection Logic:
Analyze network traffic for anomalies, such as traffic on non-standard ports or unexpected protocols.
Detect consistent traffic patterns resembling tunneling activity (e.g., DNS, ICMP tunnels).
Use deep packet inspection (DPI) to identify encapsulated traffic in legitimate protocols.

MS Sentinel:
NetworkTraffic
| where BytesSent > 0 and BytesReceived > 0
| where DestinationPort !in (80, 443, 22, 3389) // Exclude standard ports
| summarize TunnelTraffic = count() by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TunnelTraffic > 100 // Adjust threshold for environment
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, TunnelTraffic
