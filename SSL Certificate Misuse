SSL Certificate Misuse

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Exploitation for Credential Material (T1552): Misuse of SSL certificates to intercept or authenticate unauthorized traffic.
Network Traffic Obfuscation (T1027): Use of SSL certificates to mask malicious traffic.

Detection Logic:
Monitor SSL certificates for unapproved issuers or expired certificates in use.
Alert on certificates being reused across unrelated systems or domains.
Analyze traffic for certificates used by unauthorized applications or suspicious servers.

MS Sentinel:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol == "TLS"
| where SSLVersion in ("SSLv3", "TLS 1.0", "TLS 1.1") // Deprecated versions
| summarize SSLUsageCount = count() by DestinationIP, SSLVersion, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, DestinationIP, SSLVersion, SSLUsageCount
