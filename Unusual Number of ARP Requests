Unusual Number of ARP Requests

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Discovery (TA0007)
Technique: Network Sniffing (T1040)

Detection Logic:
Detect excessive ARP requests from a single host.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol == "ARP"
| summarize RequestCount = count() by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where RequestCount > 100
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, RequestCount

Testing:
Use a tool to generate excessive ARP requests in a test network.
