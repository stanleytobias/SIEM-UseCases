Unusual Beaconing Patterns

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Application Layer Protocol (T1071)

Detection Logic:
Detect repetitive and periodic traffic indicative of beaconing.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| summarize Count = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1m), DestinationIP
| where Count > 10
| project TimeGenerated, DestinationIP, Count

Testing:
Simulate beaconing traffic using a tool like Metasploit or Cobalt Strike.
