Traffic to Geographically Unusual Locations

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567.001): Traffic to unusual locations could signal data exfiltration.
Remote Access Software (T1219): Connections to unexpected geolocations may indicate unauthorized remote access.

Detection Logic:
Monitor traffic geolocation and alert on connections to countries with no business relevance.
Compare against a whitelist of expected geolocations based on historical traffic.
Correlate with new domains or IPs in threat intelligence feeds.

MS Sentinel:
NetworkTraffic
| extend GeoLocation = GetGeoLocation(DestinationIP)
| where GeoLocation.Country !in ("Country1", "Country2") // Replace with allowed countries
| summarize ConnectionCount = count() by SourceIP, DestinationIP, GeoLocation, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, GeoLocation, ConnectionCount
