Excessive Connections to Public Git Repositories

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Transfer Data to Cloud Accounts (T1567.002)

Detection Logic:
Detect repeated connections to public Git repositories from internal systems.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationDomain endswith "github.com" or DestinationDomain endswith "gitlab.com"
| summarize ConnectionCount = count() by SourceIP, DestinationDomain, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ConnectionCount > 10 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationDomain, ConnectionCount

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Clone multiple public repositories from a monitored system.
