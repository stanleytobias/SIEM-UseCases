Metadata Changes in Digital Files

MITRE Tactic:
Defense Evasion (TA0005) / Impact (TA0040)

MITRE Techniques:
Data Manipulation (T1565): Metadata tampering could indicate attempts to obfuscate activity.
Indicator Removal on Host (T1070): Changing timestamps or metadata to evade detection.

Detection Logic:
Monitor changes in file metadata, such as timestamps, owners, or access permissions.
Alert on metadata changes without corresponding content changes.
Correlate metadata changes with user or process activity for anomalies.

MS Sentinel:
FileModificationEvents
| where MetadataChanged == true
| summarize MetadataChangeCount = count() by FileName, User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where MetadataChangeCount > 10 // Adjust based on baseline activity
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, User, MetadataChangeCount
