Metadata Changes in Digital Files

MITRE Tactic:
Defense Evasion (TA0005) / Impact (TA0040)

MITRE Techniques:
Data Manipulation (T1565): Metadata tampering could indicate attempts to obfuscate activity.
Indicator Removal on Host (T1070): Changing timestamps or metadata to evade detection.

Detection Logic:
Monitor changes in file metadata, such as timestamps, owners, or access permissions.
Alert on metadata changes without corresponding content changes.
Correlate metadata changes with user or process activity for anomalies.
