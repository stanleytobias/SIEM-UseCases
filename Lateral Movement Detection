Lateral Movement Detection

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Lateral Movement (TA0008)
Technique: Remote Services (T1021)

Detection Logic:
Detect unauthorized access to remote systems or unusual login activity.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4624 // Successful logon
| where LogonType == 3 // Network logon
| summarize LoginCount = count() by TargetComputer, User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where LoginCount > 10 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, TargetComputer, User, LoginCount

Testing:
Simulate logins to multiple remote systems.
