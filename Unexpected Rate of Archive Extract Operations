MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Collection (TA0009)
Technique: Archive Collected Data (T1560)

Detection Logic:
Detect unusually high rates of file extraction operations.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileActivityLogs
| where FileExtension in (".zip", ".rar", ".7z") and Action == "Extract"
| summarize ExtractionRate = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), User
| where ExtractionRate > 10

Testing:
Extract multiple large archives in a short period using a test account.
