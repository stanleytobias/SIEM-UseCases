MITRE Tactic:
Initial Access (TA0001) / Credential Access (TA0006)

MITRE Techniques:
Exploitation of Network Protocols (T1210): Rogue DHCP servers can redirect traffic or facilitate MITM attacks.

Detection Logic:

Alert on IP or MAC addresses not matching the known authorized DHCP servers.
Correlate with network logs to identify the origin of rogue responses.
