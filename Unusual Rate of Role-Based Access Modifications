Unusual Rate of Role-Based Access Modifications

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Privilege Escalation (TA0004)
Technique: Account Manipulation (T1098)

Detection Logic:
Monitor spikes in role-based access modifications.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
IAMActivityLogs
| where Action == "RoleChange"
| summarize ModificationCount = count() by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ModificationCount > 10
| project TimeGenerated, User, ModificationCount

Testing:
Perform multiple role changes using a test account.
