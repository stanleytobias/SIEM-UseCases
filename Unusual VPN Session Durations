MITRE Tactic:

MITRE Techniques:
Valid Accounts (T1078): Unusually long VPN sessions may indicate unauthorized or malicious activity.

Detection Logic:
Monitor VPN session duration and alert on sessions exceeding normal thresholds.
Correlate with unusual data transfer volumes or connections to restricted resources.
Detect concurrent sessions for the same user from multiple locations.

MS Sentinel:
VPNLogs

| where SessionDuration > 86400 // Define abnormal duration in seconds (e.g., 24 hours)
| project TimeGenerated, User, SessionDuration, VPNIP
