Excessive Anomalies in SSL/TLS Certificates

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
Technique: Network Service Manipulation (T1570)

Detection Logic:
Detect anomalies in SSL/TLS certificate usage, such as self-signed or expired certificates.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol == "TLS" and (CertificateStatus in ("SelfSigned", "Expired"))
| summarize AnomalousCertificateUsage = count() by DestinationIP, CertificateStatus, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, DestinationIP, CertificateStatus, AnomalousCertificateUsage

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Use an application with a self-signed certificate to simulate anomalies.
