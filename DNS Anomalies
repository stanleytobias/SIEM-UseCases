DNS Anomalies

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: DNS Communication Channels (T1071.004)

Detection Logic:
Detect anomalous DNS queries, such as spikes in queries, queries for non-existent domains, or rare subdomains.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:

DNSLogs
| summarize QueryCount = count() by ClientIP, QueryName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where QueryCount > 100 // Adjust threshold for anomalies
| project TimeGenerated, ClientIP, QueryName, QueryCount

Testing:
Atomic Red Team:
Test case: T1071.004 - https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1071.004/T1071.004.yaml
Execute a script to generate unusual DNS queries.

Simplest Test:
Use nslookup or dig to query multiple non-existent or uncommon domains rapidly.
