Unusual Data Movement Between Regions

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for large data transfers between geographic regions.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where RegionSrc != RegionDest and BytesTransferred > 100000000
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, RegionSrc, RegionDest, BytesTransferred

Testing:
Transfer large files between regions in a controlled test environment.
