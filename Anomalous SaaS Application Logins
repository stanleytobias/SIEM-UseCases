Anomalous SaaS Application Logins

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006) / Initial Access (TA0001)

MITRE Techniques:
Valid Accounts (T1078): Anomalous logins may indicate compromised accounts.
Cloud Account Compromise (T1580): Suspicious logins to SaaS applications may be used to escalate access.

Detection Logic:
Monitor login attempts for geolocation, time, and device anomalies.
Detect multiple failed logins followed by a successful login (indicative of brute force).
Alert on logins from flagged IPs or devices not previously associated with the account.

MS Sentinel:
OfficeActivity
| where Operation == "UserLoggedIn"
| summarize LoginCount = count() by UserId, ApplicationName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where LoginCount > 10 // Adjust based on expected activity
| project TimeGenerated, UserId, ApplicationName, LoginCount
