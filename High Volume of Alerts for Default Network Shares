High Volume of Alerts for Default Network Shares

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Collection (TA0009)
Technique: Network Share Discovery (T1135)

Detection Logic:
Detect a surge in access attempts to default network shares.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileAuditLogs
| where FilePath contains_any (["C$", "ADMIN$"])
| summarize AccessCount = count() by User, FilePath, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where AccessCount > 20 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, FilePath, AccessCount

Testing:
Attempt to access default shares from a test machine.
