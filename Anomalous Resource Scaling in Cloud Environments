Anomalous Resource Scaling in Cloud Environments

MITRE Tactic:
Impact (TA0040) / Discovery (TA0007)

MITRE Techniques:
Resource Hijacking (T1586): Unusual scaling may indicate misuse of resources for crypto-mining or other malicious purposes.
Cloud Infrastructure Discovery (T1580): Scaling anomalies may indicate reconnaissance or preparation for abuse.

Detection Logic:
Monitor cloud activity logs for unexpected resource scaling events.
Alert on scaling triggered by non-administrative accounts or at odd times.
Correlate scaling with changes in cloud costs or resource utilization.

MS Sentinel:
AzureActivity
| where OperationName contains "Scale"
| summarize ScalingEventCount = count() by ResourceId, Caller, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ScalingEventCount > 5 // Define threshold for abnormal scaling events
| project TimeGenerated, ResourceId, Caller, ScalingEventCount
