Credential Dumping Detection

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006)

MITRE Techniques:
OS Credential Dumping (T1003): Extracting credentials from memory or SAM files.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for suspicious process activity involving tools like Mimikatz or lsass.exe.
Detect access to sensitive files like SAM, SYSTEM, or SECURITY registry hives.
Alert on process injection attempts targeting credential-related processes.

MS Sentinel:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4688 // Process creation
| where ProcessName has_any ("lsass.exe", "dump.exe", "procdump.exe", "mimikatz.exe") // Known credential dumping tools
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, ProcessName, CommandLine, AccountName
