Suspicious Use of Web Proxies

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
Technique: Traffic Proxy (T1090)

Detection Logic:
Detect high volumes of traffic routed through web proxy services.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationIP in (knownProxyIPs)
| summarize TrafficVolume = sum(BytesTransferred) by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, TrafficVolume

Testing:
Configure a test system to use a proxy service.
