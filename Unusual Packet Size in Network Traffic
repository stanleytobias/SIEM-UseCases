Unusual Packet Size in Network Traffic

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048): Abnormal packet sizes may indicate data exfiltration.
Network Traffic Obfuscation (T1027): Large or irregular packets could signal obfuscation attempts.

Detection Logic:
Inspect packet headers and alert on unusually large or fragmented packets.
Monitor for spikes in non-standard payload sizes.
Correlate abnormal packet sizes with known malicious domains or protocols.

MS Sentinel:
NetworkTraffic
| where PacketSize > 1500 or PacketSize < 100 // Adjust thresholds for abnormal sizes
| summarize PacketCount = count() by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, PacketSize, PacketCount
