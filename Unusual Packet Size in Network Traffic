Unusual Packet Size in Network Traffic

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048): Abnormal packet sizes may indicate data exfiltration.
Network Traffic Obfuscation (T1027): Large or irregular packets could signal obfuscation attempts.

Detection Logic:
Inspect packet headers and alert on unusually large or fragmented packets.
Monitor for spikes in non-standard payload sizes.
Correlate abnormal packet sizes with known malicious domains or protocols.
