MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Initial Access (TA0001)
Technique: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)

Detection Logic:
Detect unexpected traffic or access patterns within the DMZ.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationZone == "DMZ" and (BytesTransferred > 10000000 or Protocol not in ("HTTP", "HTTPS"))
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, BytesTransferred, Protocol

Testing:
Perform a test scan or data transfer to DMZ systems.
