High Frequency of Network Disconnects

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Network Denial of Service (T1498)

Detection Logic:
Monitor logs for frequent network disconnections.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkConnectionLogs
| where EventType == "Disconnect"
| summarize DisconnectCount = count() by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where DisconnectCount > 10 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, DisconnectCount

Testing:
Simulate disconnections by repeatedly disabling and enabling network adapters.
