Data Exfiltration Attempts

MITRE Tactic:
Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567.001): Exfiltration using legitimate web services like cloud storage.
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048): Data exfiltration through non-standard protocols.

Detection Logic:
Monitor outbound traffic for large data transfers to unauthorized destinations.
Alert on unusual encryption in outgoing traffic, especially to unknown IPs.
Correlate with file access and upload logs to detect staging of data for exfiltration.
