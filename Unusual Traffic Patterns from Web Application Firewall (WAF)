Technique: Use Alternate Authentication Material (T1550.003)

Detection Logic:
Detect anomalous traffic patterns passing through the WAF.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
WAFLogs
| summarize RequestCount = count() by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where RequestCount > 1000
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, RequestCount

Testing:
Send a high volume of traffic through the WAF.
