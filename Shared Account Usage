Shared Account Usage

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Persistence (TA0003)
Technique: Valid Accounts (T1078)

Detection Logic:
Detect logins to shared accounts from different locations or IPs.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
AuthenticationLogs
| where AccountName in (sharedAccounts)
| summarize LoginsByIP = dcount(SourceIP) by AccountName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where LoginsByIP > 1
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, LoginsByIP

Testing:
Simulate shared account usage from different devices or locations.
