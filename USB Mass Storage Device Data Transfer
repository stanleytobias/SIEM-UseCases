MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Exfiltration Over Physical Medium (T1052)

Detection Logic:
Monitor data transfers to USB mass storage devices.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileActivityLogs
| where DestinationDevice == "USB" and BytesTransferred > 1000000
| project TimeGenerated, SourcePath, DestinationDevice, BytesTransferred

Testing:
Copy large files to a USB mass storage device.
