Command and Control Traffic Detection

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011)

MITRE Techniques:
C2 Communication over Web Protocols (T1071.001): Detectable through anomalies in HTTP/S traffic.
Encrypted Channel Communication (T1573): Using encryption to obfuscate malicious traffic.

Detection Logic:
Analyze outbound traffic for beaconing patterns or frequent connections to rare domains.
Use threat intelligence feeds to flag traffic to known C2 domains or IPs.
Correlate with endpoint activity, such as suspicious processes initiating traffic.
