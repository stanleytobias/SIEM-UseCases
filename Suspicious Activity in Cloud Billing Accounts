Suspicious Activity in Cloud Billing Accounts

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Resource Hijacking (T1496)

Detection Logic:
Detect unusual changes in billing activity, such as spikes in resource usage.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
CloudBillingLogs
| summarize BillingChange = max(TotalCost) - min(TotalCost) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| where BillingChange > 1000 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, BillingChange

Testing:
Deploy resource-intensive applications in a test cloud account.
