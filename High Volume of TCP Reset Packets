High Volume of TCP Reset Packets

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Network Denial of Service (T1498)

Detection Logic:
Detect a surge in TCP RST packets.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol == "TCP" and TCPFlags contains "RST"
| summarize TCPResetCount = count() by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TCPResetCount > 50 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, TCPResetCount

Testing:
Use tools like hping3 to generate TCP RST packets.
