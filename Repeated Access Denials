Repeated Access Denials

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Brute Force (T1110)

Detection Logic:
Detect multiple access denial events within a short timeframe.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625 // Failed login
| summarize DenialCount = count() by AccountName, bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
| where DenialCount > 5 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, DenialCount

Testing:
Attempt multiple incorrect logins to a test account.
