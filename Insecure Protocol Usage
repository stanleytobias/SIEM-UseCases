Insecure Protocol Usage

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
Technique: Network Service Scanning (T1046)

Detection Logic:
Detect usage of deprecated or insecure protocols.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol in ("SMBv1", "Telnet", "FTP")
| summarize UsageCount = count() by SourceIP, Protocol, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, Protocol, UsageCount

Testing:
Use insecure protocols such as telnet or FTP to simulate traffic.
