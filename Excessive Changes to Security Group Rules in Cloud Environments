Excessive Changes to Security Group Rules in Cloud Environments

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
Technique: Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure (T1578)

Detection Logic:
Detect multiple rule modifications in a short period in cloud security groups.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
AzureActivity
| where OperationName contains "SecurityGroupRule"
| summarize RuleChangeCount = count() by InitiatedBy, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where RuleChangeCount > 5 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, InitiatedBy, RuleChangeCount

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Modify security group rules in a test cloud environment.
