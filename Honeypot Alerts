Honeypot Alerts

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Discovery (TA0007)
Technique: Network Service Scanning (T1046)

Detection Logic:
Monitor alerts generated by honeypots in the network.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
HoneypotLogs
| summarize AlertCount = count() by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where AlertCount > 10 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, AlertCount

Testing:
Simulate network scanning tools like nmap on the honeypot.
