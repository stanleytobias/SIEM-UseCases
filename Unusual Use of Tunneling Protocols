Unusual Use of Tunneling Protocols

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Protocol Tunneling (T1572)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for usage of tunneling protocols like ICMP or DNS.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol in ("ICMP", "DNS") and BytesTransferred > 1000000
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, Protocol

Testing:
Simulate tunneling protocols like ICMP in a controlled test setup.
