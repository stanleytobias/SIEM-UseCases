Credential Sharing

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006)

MITRE Techniques:
Valid Accounts (T1078): Credential sharing could indicate unauthorized access.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for simultaneous logins from different geolocations or devices using the same credentials.
Alert on abnormal session durations or multiple concurrent sessions for the same user.
Correlate with file access logs to detect misuse of shared credentials.

MS Sentinel:
AuthenticationLogs
| summarize LoginCount = count() by UserPrincipalName, ClientIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where LoginCount > 1 and count() > 1 // Simultaneous logins from multiple IPs
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, ClientIP, LoginCount
