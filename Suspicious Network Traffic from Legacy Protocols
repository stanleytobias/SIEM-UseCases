Suspicious Network Traffic from Legacy Protocols

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Lateral Movement (TA0008)
Technique: Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210)

Detection Logic:
Detect traffic using outdated protocols such as SMBv1 or Telnet.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol in ("SMBv1", "Telnet", "FTP")
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, Protocol

Testing:
Use legacy protocol tools to generate traffic in a controlled environment.
