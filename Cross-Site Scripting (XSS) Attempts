Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attempts

MITRE Tactic:
Initial Access (TA0001) / Execution (TA0002)

MITRE Techniques:
Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203): Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications.

Detection Logic:
Monitor web server logs for requests containing malicious scripts or encoded payloads.
Detect attempts to inject <script> tags, JavaScript, or unusual URL parameters.
Correlate with WAF alerts and user activity to identify targeted sessions.

MS Sentinel:
WAFLogs
| where RequestUri contains "<script>" or RequestUri contains "javascript:"
| summarize XSSAttemptCount = count() by ClientIP, RequestUri, HttpMethod, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, ClientIP, RequestUri, HttpMethod, XSSAttemptCount
