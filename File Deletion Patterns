File Deletion Patterns

MITRE Tactic:
Defense Evasion (TA0005) / Impact (TA0040)

MITRE Techniques:
Indicator Removal on Host (T1070): Deleting files to hide activity.
Data Destruction (T1485): Erasing files as part of a broader malicious goal.

Detection Logic:
Monitor file system activity for bulk deletion events.
Compare deletion activity against normal user or system patterns.
Correlate deletions with recent file access or modification logs to detect malicious intent.
