Unusual File Compression Activity

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Collection (TA0009)
Technique: Archive Collected Data (T1560)

Detection Logic:
Monitor file compression operations with abnormal frequency or size.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileActivityLogs
| where FileExtension in (".zip", ".rar", ".7z") and User not in (authorizedUsers)
| summarize CompressionCount = count() by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where CompressionCount > 10

Testing:
Compress multiple files in a short timeframe using a test account.
