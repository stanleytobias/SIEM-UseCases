Potential Lateral Movement Detected

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Lateral Movement (TA0008)
Technique: Remote Services (T1021)

Detection Logic:
Detect logons or access to multiple systems from the same user account.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4624 // Successful logon
| summarize LateralMovementCount = count() by AccountName, TargetComputer, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where LateralMovementCount > 5 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, TargetComputer, LateralMovementCount

Testing:
Log into multiple systems using a single account.
