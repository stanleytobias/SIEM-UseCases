Spear Phishing (T1566.002): Phishing URLs are used to compromise user accounts or deliver malware.

Detection Logic:
Monitor email content for URLs flagged in threat intelligence feeds or known phishing patterns.
Analyze attachments for links redirecting to suspicious domains.
Alert on emails from untrusted senders containing URLs with short-lived domains.
