Suspicious ARP Spoofing Detection

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: ARP Cache Poisoning (T1557.002)

Detection Logic:
Detect duplicate IP addresses with different MAC addresses.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol == "ARP"
| summarize MACCount = dcount(MACAddress) by SourceIP
| where MACCount > 1
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, MACCount

Testing:
Use a tool like arpspoof to perform ARP spoofing in a controlled environment.
