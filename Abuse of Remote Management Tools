Abuse of Remote Management Tools

MITRE Tactic:
Execution (TA0002) / Lateral Movement (TA0008)

MITRE Techniques:
Remote Services (T1021): Unauthorized use of tools like RDP, PSExec, or SSH.
Use of Remote Management Tools (T1219): Abuse of legitimate tools to execute commands or exfiltrate data.

Detection Logic:
Monitor logs for unauthorized or unusual use of remote management tools.
Detect connections from unknown IPs or during non-business hours.
Alert on lateral movement patterns following remote access.
