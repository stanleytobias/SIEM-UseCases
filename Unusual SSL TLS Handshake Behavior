Unusual SSL/TLS Handshake Behavior

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Encrypted Channel Communication (T1573): Anomalous handshakes could signal encrypted C2 traffic.
Protocol Tunneling (T1572): SSL/TLS anomalies may indicate tunneling.

Detection Logic:
Monitor traffic for incomplete or failed SSL/TLS handshakes.
Alert on certificates with unusual attributes (e.g., self-signed, expired).
Detect handshakes involving uncommon cipher suites or deprecated protocols.
