Unusual Spikes in IoT Data Transmission

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048)

Detection Logic:
Detect sudden spikes in data transmission from IoT devices.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
IoTDeviceLogs
| summarize TotalBytes = sum(BytesTransferred) by DeviceID, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TotalBytes > 100000000 // Set threshold based on normal baselines
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceID, TotalBytes

Testing:
Simulate high data transmission from an IoT device in a controlled environment.
