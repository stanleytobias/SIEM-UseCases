Command and Control Traffic

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011)

MITRE Techniques:
Application Layer Protocols (T1071): C2 traffic may use application-layer protocols like DNS or HTTPS.
Protocol Tunneling (T1572): Obfuscating C2 traffic within legitimate protocols.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for DNS queries to dynamically generated domains (DGA) or rare domains.
Detect anomalies in TLS handshakes, such as self-signed certificates.
Alert on non-standard port usage or high volumes of encrypted traffic.

MS Sentinel:
NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationDomain in (dynamic(["C2_Domain_1", "C2_Domain_2"])) // Replace with C2 domains from threat intelligence
| summarize C2ConnectionCount = count() by SourceIP, DestinationDomain, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationDomain, C2ConnectionCount
