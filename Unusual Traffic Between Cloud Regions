Unusual Traffic Between Cloud Regions

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Exfiltration Over Network Medium (T1048)

Detection Logic:
Monitor traffic between cloud regions that deviates from normal patterns.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where RegionSrc != RegionDest
| summarize TrafficVolume = sum(BytesTransferred) by RegionSrc, RegionDest, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TrafficVolume > 100000000 // Set threshold based on normal baselines
| project TimeGenerated, RegionSrc, RegionDest, TrafficVolume

Testing:
Transfer large amounts of data between two cloud regions in a test setup.
