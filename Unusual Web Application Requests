Unusual Web Application Requests

MITRE Tactic:
Initial Access (TA0001) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Application Layer Protocols (T1071): Abnormal web requests could indicate malicious communication.
Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068): Web application requests could exploit vulnerabilities.

Detection Logic:
Monitor HTTP/S requests for anomalous patterns (e.g., unexpected methods, payloads, or parameters).
Alert on requests with SQL injection, XSS, or directory traversal indicators.
Compare against a baseline of normal application traffic patterns.
