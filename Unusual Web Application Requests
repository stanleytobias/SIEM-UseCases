Unusual Web Application Requests

MITRE Tactic:
Initial Access (TA0001) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Application Layer Protocols (T1071): Abnormal web requests could indicate malicious communication.
Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068): Web application requests could exploit vulnerabilities.

Detection Logic:
Monitor HTTP/S requests for anomalous patterns (e.g., unexpected methods, payloads, or parameters).
Alert on requests with SQL injection, XSS, or directory traversal indicators.
Compare against a baseline of normal application traffic patterns.

MS Sentinel:
WAFLogs
| where Action in ("Blocked", "Challenged")
| summarize RequestCount = count() by ClientIP, RequestUri, HttpMethod, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where RequestCount > 50 // Adjust threshold based on environment
| project TimeGenerated, ClientIP, RequestUri, HttpMethod, RequestCount
