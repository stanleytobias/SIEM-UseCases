Denial of Service Attacks on Web Servers

MITRE Tactic:
Impact (TA0040)

MITRE Techniques:
Application Denial of Service (T1499): Flooding web servers with traffic to deny access.

Detection Logic:
Monitor web server logs for spikes in HTTP requests or high error rates (e.g., 503 errors).
Alert on traffic patterns with high request volumes from a single IP or range.
Correlate with WAF or load balancer logs for additional context.

MS Sentinel:
WebServerLogs
| where ResponseCode == 503 // Service Unavailable
| summarize DoSRequestCount = count() by ClientIP, URL, bin(TimeGenerated, 1m)
| where DoSRequestCount > 1000 // Adjust threshold for detection
| project TimeGenerated, ClientIP, URL, DoSRequestCount
