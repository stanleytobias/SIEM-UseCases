Excessive SSH Authentication Failures from Known IPs

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Brute Force (T1110)

Detection Logic:
Detect multiple failed SSH logins from known IPs.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
SSHLogs
| where EventType == "AuthenticationFailed"
| where SourceIP in (trustedIPs) // Replace with known IPs
| summarize FailedSSHCount = count() by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailedSSHCount > 5 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, FailedSSHCount

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Attempt multiple failed SSH logins from a test machine.
