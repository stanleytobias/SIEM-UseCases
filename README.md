SIEM Detection Use-Cases

As a detection engineer, it is sometimes a challenge to come up with scenarios or events that may be important or applicable to your environment. Sometimes you just do not know what you do not know. This is a collection of scenarios or events I have encountered from anywhere (at work, reading materials, public posts, threat reports, etc.). It will be a working list as I encounter them from day-to-day. Feel free to contribute. Ideally, there should be applicable SIEM queries for each whenever possible (KQL, S1 STAR, Sigma, etc.). It will eventually include an Atomic test or atleast a simple way to test these use-cases.

Things to consider especially on KQL queries is that the some of the table names will be different from what you are using so you can just adjust accordingly. The same applies to some Actions as well.
