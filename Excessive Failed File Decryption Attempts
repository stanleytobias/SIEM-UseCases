Excessive Failed File Decryption Attempts

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Brute Force (T1110)

Detection Logic:
Detect multiple failed attempts to decrypt files using incorrect keys.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileAuditLogs
| where ActionType == "DecryptionFailed"
| summarize FailedDecryptionCount = count() by User, FilePath, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailedDecryptionCount > 5 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, FilePath, FailedDecryptionCount

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Attempt to decrypt an encrypted file using invalid keys.
