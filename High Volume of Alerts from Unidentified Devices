High Volume of Alerts from Unidentified Devices

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Discovery (TA0007)
Technique: Network Device Discovery (T1046)

Detection Logic:
Monitor security alerts generated by devices not in the asset inventory.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
SecurityAlert
| where DeviceName !in (authorizedDevices) // Replace with the list of known devices
| summarize AlertCount = count() by DeviceName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where AlertCount > 10 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, AlertCount

Testing:
Connect an unauthorized device to the network and generate a benign activity.
