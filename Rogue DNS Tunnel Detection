Rogue DNS Tunnel Detection

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Application Layer Protocol (T1071.004)

Detection Logic:
Detect high volumes of DNS TXT queries or abnormal DNS traffic patterns.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
DNSLogs
| where QueryType == "TXT"
| summarize QueryCount = count() by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where QueryCount > 50 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, QueryCount

Testing:
Use a DNS tunneling tool (e.g., dnscat2) in a controlled environment.
