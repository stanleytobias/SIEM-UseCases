Suspicious Token Generation

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Application API Abuse (T1529)

Detection Logic:
Detect high token generation activity from the same user or IP.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
AuthenticationLogs
| where Action == "GenerateToken"
| summarize TokenCount = count() by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TokenCount > 10
| project TimeGenerated, User, TokenCount

Testing:
Simulate token generation via API calls in a test environment.
