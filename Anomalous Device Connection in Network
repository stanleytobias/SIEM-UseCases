Anomalous Device Connection in Network

MITRE Tactic:
Initial Access (TA0001) / Lateral Movement (TA0008)

MITRE Techniques:
Exploitation of Network Protocols (T1210): Anomalous devices may exploit network protocols.
Rogue Devices (T1200): Unauthorized devices connected to the network.

Detection Logic:
Monitor DHCP logs for new or unauthorized devices connecting to the network.
Detect MAC address spoofing or unusual IP allocations.
Correlate device connections with network activity logs for anomalies.

MS Sentinel:
NetworkConnectionEvents
| where DeviceType != "KnownDeviceType" // Replace with trusted device types
| summarize ConnectionCount = count() by SourceIP, DeviceType, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ConnectionCount > 10 // Define threshold for abnormal connections
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DeviceType, ConnectionCount
