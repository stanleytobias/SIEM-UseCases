Sudden Increase in Cloud Costs (Possible Crypto Mining)

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Resource Hijacking (T1496)

Detection Logic:
Monitor cloud billing logs for a significant increase in costs.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
CloudBillingLogs
| summarize CostIncrease = max(TotalCost) - min(TotalCost) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| where CostIncrease > 1000 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, CostIncrease

Testing:
Deploy a resource-intensive application in a cloud test environment.
