Traffic Spikes to Tor Exit Nodes

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Proxy (T1090.003)

Detection Logic:
Detect high traffic volume directed to Tor exit nodes.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationIP in (knownTorExitNodes)
| summarize TrafficVolume = sum(BytesTransferred) by DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TrafficVolume > 100000000 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, DestinationIP, TrafficVolume

Testing:
Simulate high traffic to Tor exit nodes in a test environment.
