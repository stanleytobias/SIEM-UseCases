Suspected Insider Reconnaissance

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Discovery (TA0007)
Technique: File and Directory Discovery (T1083)

Detection Logic:
Detect users accessing a high volume of sensitive files or directories.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileAuditLogs
| where FilePath contains "sensitive" or FilePath contains "confidential"
| summarize AccessCount = count() by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where AccessCount > 50 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, AccessCount

Testing:
Access sensitive files from a test account.
