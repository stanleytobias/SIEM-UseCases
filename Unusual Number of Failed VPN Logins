Unusual Number of Failed VPN Logins

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Brute Force (T1110)

Detection Logic:
Monitor repeated failed VPN login attempts.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
VPNAuthenticationLogs
| where Result == "Failure"
| summarize FailureCount = count() by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailureCount > 10
| project TimeGenerated, User, FailureCount

Testing:
Attempt multiple failed VPN logins using test credentials.
