Abnormal Web Activity

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011) / Initial Access (TA0001)

MITRE Techniques:
Spear Phishing (T1566): Abnormal web activity may result from phishing campaigns.
Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567.001): Unusual activity could signal exfiltration via HTTP/S.

Detection Logic:
Analyze web proxy logs for sudden increases in browsing activity or visits to flagged URLs.
Monitor for access to known malicious or newly registered domains.
Alert on non-standard HTTP methods or unusually high HTTP error rates.

MS Sentinel:
WebProxyLogs
