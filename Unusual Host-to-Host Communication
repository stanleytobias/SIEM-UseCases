Unusual Host-to-Host Communication

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Lateral Movement (TA0008)
Technique: Remote Services (T1021)

Detection Logic:
Detect unexpected or high-frequency communications between internal hosts.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationIP in (internalIPs) and SourceIP in (internalIPs)
| summarize CommunicationCount = count() by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where CommunicationCount > 50

Testing:
Generate high-frequency host-to-host communications in a test environment.
