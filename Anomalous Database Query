Anomalous Database Query

MITRE Tactic:
Discovery (TA0007) / Credential Access (TA0006)

MITRE Techniques:
Application Layer Protocol (T1071): Unusual queries may indicate reconnaissance or data theft.
Data Exfiltration (T1567): Anomalous queries could signal data theft attempts.

Detection Logic:
Monitor database logs for queries outside normal patterns (e.g., unusual SELECT, DELETE, or DROP statements).
Alert on queries by non-privileged users targeting sensitive tables.
Correlate queries with login sessions and user access logs.
