MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486)

Detection Logic:
Monitor file events for patterns of encryption activity.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileAuditLogs
| where FileExtension in (".encrypted", ".lock", ".crypto") // Common ransomware extensions
| summarize EncryptionActivity = count() by FilePath, User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, FilePath, User, EncryptionActivity

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Encrypt files with a known encryption tool on a test system.
