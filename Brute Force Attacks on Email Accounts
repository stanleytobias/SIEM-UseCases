Brute Force Attacks on Email Accounts

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006)

MITRE Techniques:
Password Guessing (T1110.001): Repeated login attempts to guess email account credentials.

Detection Logic:
Monitor email server logs for multiple failed login attempts followed by a success.
Detect unusual login attempts from unknown IPs or geolocations.
Correlate with account lockouts or privilege escalation attempts.

MS Sentinel:
OfficeActivity
| where Operation == "FailedLogin"
| summarize FailedLoginCount = count() by UserId, ClientIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailedLoginCount > 10 // Adjust threshold for brute force
| project TimeGenerated, UserId, ClientIP, FailedLoginCount
