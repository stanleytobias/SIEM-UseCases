Sudden Drops in Network Bandwidth Utilization

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Network Denial of Service (T1498)

Detection Logic:
Identify sudden drops in network bandwidth usage.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| summarize BandwidthUsage = sum(BytesTransferred) by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
| order by BandwidthUsage asc
| project TimeGenerated, BandwidthUsage

Testing:
Simulate a sudden reduction in traffic using bandwidth-limiting tools.
