High Volume of Failed SFTP Transfers

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Brute Force (T1110)

Detection Logic:
Monitor logs for repeated failed SFTP transfer attempts.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
SFTPLogs
| where Status == "Failed"
| summarize FailedTransferCount = count() by SourceIP, User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailedTransferCount > 10 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, User, FailedTransferCount

Testing:
Attempt SFTP transfers with incorrect credentials or invalid files.
