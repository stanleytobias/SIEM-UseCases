MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Data Destruction (T1485)

Detection Logic:
Detect large volumes of file write operations.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileAuditLogs
| where ActionType == "Write"
| summarize WriteCount = count() by User, FilePath, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where WriteCount > 100 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, FilePath, WriteCount

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Write data to multiple files using a loop in a script.
