Multiple Device MAC Address Spoofing

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
Technique: Network Service Manipulation (T1570)

Detection Logic:
Detect multiple MAC addresses sharing the same IP.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| summarize MACCount = dcount(MACAddress) by ClientIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where MACCount > 2 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, ClientIP, MACCount

Testing:
Spoof MAC addresses using tools like macchanger.
