Compromised Host Communicating with Command and Control Server

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011)

MITRE Techniques:
C2 Communication over Web Protocols (T1071.001): C2 communication initiated by compromised hosts.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for suspicious outbound traffic patterns, such as beaconing.
Alert on known C2 indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as flagged IPs or domains.
Correlate with endpoint logs to identify compromised processes initiating traffic.
