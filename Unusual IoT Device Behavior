Unusual IoT Device Behavior

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Discovery (TA0007)
Technique: Network Sniffing (T1040)

Detection Logic:
Detect anomalies in IoT device traffic, such as unexpected data rates or communication patterns.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
IoTDeviceLogs
| where DataRate > 1000000 or Action not in ("ExpectedActions")
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceID, DataRate, Action

Testing:
Simulate abnormal IoT device behavior by overloading traffic or sending unexpected commands.
