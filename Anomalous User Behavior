Anomalous User Behavior

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Valid Accounts (T1078): Deviations from baseline user behavior could signal account compromise.

Detection Logic:
Establish behavioral baselines (e.g., login times, resource access patterns).
Detect deviations such as access to unusual resources, abnormal login times, or geolocations.
Correlate anomalies with privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.
