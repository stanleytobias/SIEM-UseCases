Excessive Network Scanning

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Discovery (TA0007)
Technique: Network Service Scanning (T1046)

Detection Logic:
Detect multiple connection attempts to a large range of ports or IPs.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| summarize ConnectionAttempts = count() by SourceIP, DestinationPort, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ConnectionAttempts > 100 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationPort, ConnectionAttempts

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Use a scanning tool like nmap to scan multiple IPs or ports.
