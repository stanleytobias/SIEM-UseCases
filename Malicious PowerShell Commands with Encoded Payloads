Malicious PowerShell Commands with Encoded Payloads

MITRE Tactic:
Execution (TA0002) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
PowerShell (T1059.001): Encoding is often used to obfuscate malicious PowerShell commands.

Detection Logic:
Monitor PowerShell logs for commands containing encoded payloads (e.g., -EncodedCommand).
Alert on script executions with known malicious patterns or flagged keywords.
Correlate with user behavior and privilege escalation attempts.

MS Sentinel:
PowerShellCommandLogs
| where CommandLine contains "-EncodedCommand"
| where CommandLine matches regex @"[A-Za-z0-9+/=]{100,}" // Detect base64-encoded payloads
| project TimeGenerated, User, CommandLine, Computer
