Changes to File Ownership

MITRE Tactic:
Persistence (TA0003) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Permission Changes (T1222): Changing file ownership to gain or maintain unauthorized access.
Indicator Removal on Host (T1070): Altering ownership to hide malicious activity.

Detection Logic:
Monitor file system event logs for ownership change operations.
Correlate changes with known administrative accounts or unusual user activity.
Alert on unexpected ownership changes for sensitive files or directories.
