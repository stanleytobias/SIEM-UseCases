Changes to File Ownership

MITRE Tactic:
Persistence (TA0003) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Permission Changes (T1222): Changing file ownership to gain or maintain unauthorized access.
Indicator Removal on Host (T1070): Altering ownership to hide malicious activity.

Detection Logic:
Monitor file system event logs for ownership change operations.
Correlate changes with known administrative accounts or unusual user activity.
Alert on unexpected ownership changes for sensitive files or directories.

MS Sentinel:
FileAuditLogs
| where ActionType == "ChangeFileOwnership"
| summarize ChangeCount = count() by FilePath, Initiator, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ChangeCount > 3 // Adjust based on environment
| project TimeGenerated, FilePath, Initiator, ChangeCount
