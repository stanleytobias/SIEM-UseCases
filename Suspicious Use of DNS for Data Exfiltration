Suspicious Use of DNS for Data Exfiltration

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium (T1048.003)

Detection Logic:
Detect high volumes of DNS queries with large TXT records.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
DNSLogs
| where QueryType == "TXT" and strlen(QueryResponse) > 500
| summarize QueryCount = count() by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where QueryCount > 10
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, QueryCount

Testing:
Use a DNS tunneling tool like dnscat2 in a controlled environment.
