Sudden Increase in File Reads

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Collection (TA0009)
Technique: File and Directory Discovery (T1083)

Detection Logic:
Detect a sharp rise in file read operations within a short timeframe.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileAuditLogs
| where Action == "Read"
| summarize ReadCount = count() by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ReadCount > 100 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, ReadCount

Testing:
Use a script to read multiple files in a test environment.
