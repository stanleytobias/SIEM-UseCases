Email Reply Patterns

MITRE Tactic:
Collection (TA0009) / Credential Access (TA0006)

MITRE Techniques:
Spear Phishing (T1566.002): Abnormal replies could indicate phishing activity or compromised accounts.
Email Collection (T1114): Monitoring reply behavior to collect sensitive information.

Detection Logic:
Monitor email metadata for reply patterns deviating from normal (e.g., time of reply, recipient domain).
Detect multiple replies to unknown or flagged external domains.
Alert on replies containing unusual keywords or large attachments.

MS Sentinel:
OfficeActivity
| where Operation == "Send"
| summarize ReplyCount = count() by UserId, Recipient, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ReplyCount > 50 // Adjust threshold for normal reply frequency
| project TimeGenerated, UserId, Recipient, ReplyCount
