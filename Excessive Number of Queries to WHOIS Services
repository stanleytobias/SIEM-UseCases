Excessive Number of Queries to WHOIS Services

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Discovery (TA0007)
Technique: Domain Information Query (T1596.002)

Detection Logic:
Detect repeated WHOIS queries.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
DNSLogs
| where QueryName contains "whois"
| summarize QueryCount = count() by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where QueryCount > 10 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, QueryCount

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Use whois command to query multiple domains.
