Detect kernel exploitation attempts by monitoring suspicious processes or system logs.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625 and PrivilegeName == "SeDebugPrivilege"
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, PrivilegeName, Status

Testing:
Use a test kernel exploit tool in a controlled environment.
