Anomalous File Transfers

MITRE Tactic:
Collection (TA0009) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Data Staged for Exfiltration (T1074): Unexpected file transfers may indicate staging of data for exfiltration.
Data Transfer to Cloud Accounts (T1567.002): Suspicious file uploads may indicate exfiltration.

Detection Logic:
Monitor file transfer logs for uploads to unauthorized destinations or domains.
Alert on large file transfers or unusual file types being transferred.
Correlate with user behavior and access logs to detect anomalies.
