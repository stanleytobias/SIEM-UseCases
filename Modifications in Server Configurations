Modifications in Server Configurations

MITRE Tactic:
Defense Evasion (TA0005) / Impact (TA0040)

MITRE Techniques:
Impair Defenses (T1562): Modifying server configurations to disable logging or weaken security.

Detection Logic:
Monitor server configuration files for unauthorized changes.
Alert on changes to logging, authentication, or network settings.
Correlate with user activity logs to identify the initiator of the changes.

MS Sentinel:
ConfigurationChangeEvents
| where ConfigurationType == "Server"
| where Initiator !in (authorizedAdmins) // Replace with authorized admin accounts
| summarize ModificationCount = count() by ServerName, ConfigurationChange, Initiator, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, ServerName, ConfigurationChange, Initiator, ModificationCount
