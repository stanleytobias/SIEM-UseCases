Active Directory Enumeration

MITRE Tactic:
Discovery (TA0007)

MITRE Techniques:
Account Discovery (T1087.002): Enumeration of AD objects for reconnaissance.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for LDAP queries targeting sensitive AD objects (e.g., user accounts, group memberships).
Detect unusual tools or processes performing AD enumeration.
Correlate with login activity and privilege escalation attempts.

MS Sentinel:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID in (4662, 4720) // Object enumeration or new account creation
| where ObjectClass == "User" or ObjectClass == "Computer"
| summarize EnumerationCount = count() by AccountName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where EnumerationCount > 10 // Adjust based on baseline
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, EnumerationCount
