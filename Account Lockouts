Account Lockouts

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Brute Force (T1110): Excessive failed attempts may result in lockouts.
Account Manipulation (T1098): Malicious activity leading to lockouts as a distraction or defense evasion.

Detection Logic:
Monitor authentication logs for repeated failed attempts leading to lockouts.
Alert on lockouts across multiple accounts within a short period.
Correlate with geolocation or device logs to identify unauthorized access attempts.
