Account Lockouts

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Brute Force (T1110): Excessive failed attempts may result in lockouts.
Account Manipulation (T1098): Malicious activity leading to lockouts as a distraction or defense evasion.

Detection Logic:
Monitor authentication logs for repeated failed attempts leading to lockouts.
Alert on lockouts across multiple accounts within a short period.
Correlate with geolocation or device logs to identify unauthorized access attempts.

MS Sentinel:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4740 // Account lockout event
| summarize LockoutCount = count() by AccountName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where LockoutCount > 5 // Adjust threshold for abnormal frequency
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, LockoutCount
