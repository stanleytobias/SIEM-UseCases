Multiple User Account Lockouts

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Brute Force (T1110)

Detection Logic:
Detect spikes in account lockouts within a short period.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4740 // Account lockout
| summarize LockoutCount = count() by TargetAccount, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where LockoutCount > 5 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, TargetAccount, LockoutCount

Testing:
Attempt multiple failed logins to trigger account lockouts.
