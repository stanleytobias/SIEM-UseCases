Suspicious Connections to Obsolete Protocol Endpoints

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
Technique: Protocol Tunneling (T1572)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for traffic to endpoints using outdated protocols (e.g., SMBv1).

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol in ("SMBv1", "Telnet")
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, Protocol

Testing:
Use a test system to connect via an outdated protocol like telnet.
