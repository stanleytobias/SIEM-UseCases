Rapid File Encryption Events

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for rapid file encryption based on file extension changes.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileAuditLogs
| where FileExtension in (".encrypted", ".lock", ".crypto")
| summarize EncryptionEventCount = count() by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1m)
| where EncryptionEventCount > 10 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, EncryptionEventCount

Testing:
Simulate rapid file encryption with a benign ransomware simulation tool.
