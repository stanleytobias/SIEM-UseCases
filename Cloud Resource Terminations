Cloud Resource Terminations

MITRE Tactic:
Impact (TA0040) / Execution (TA0002)

MITRE Techniques:
Resource Hijacking (T1586): Abrupt terminations to disrupt legitimate activity or cover traces.
Impair Defenses (T1562): Destroying resources to reduce visibility.

Detection Logic:
Track resource termination events in cloud activity logs.
Alert on bulk terminations or terminations initiated from unusual IPs or accounts.
Correlate with suspicious events like privilege escalation or failed login attempts.
