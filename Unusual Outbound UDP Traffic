Unusual Outbound UDP Traffic

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Protocol Tunneling (T1572)

Detection Logic:
Monitor spikes in outbound UDP traffic.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol == "UDP" and BytesTransferred > 1000000
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, BytesTransferred

Testing:
Generate a high volume of outbound UDP traffic in a test environment.
