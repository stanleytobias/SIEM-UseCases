Unusual Correlation in SIEM Event Sources

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Detection (TA0028)
Technique: Event Correlation (T1566)

Detection Logic:
Detect anomalies or patterns across multiple event sources.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
union AuthenticationLogs, NetworkTraffic, ProcessCreationEvents
| summarize EventCount = count() by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where EventCount > threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, EventCount

Testing:
Generate anomalous activities across different log sources.
