Unusual Volume of DNS Queries

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Application Layer Protocol (T1071.004)

Detection Logic:
Detect high volume of DNS queries from a single host in a short period.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
DNSQueryLogs
| summarize QueryCount = count() by ClientIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where QueryCount > 500 // Threshold depends on normal baseline
| project TimeGenerated, ClientIP, QueryCount

Testing:
Generate large numbers of DNS queries from a test system.
