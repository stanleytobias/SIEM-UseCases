Access Outside Business Hours

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Valid Accounts (T1078): Use of valid accounts at unusual times may indicate compromise.

Detection Logic:
Track login activity against pre-defined business hours.
Alert on logins or resource access during weekends, holidays, or late at night.
Correlate with geolocation and access device logs for anomalies.

MS Sentinel:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4624 // Successful login
| extend LoginHour = datetime_part("hour", TimeGenerated)
| where LoginHour < 8 or LoginHour > 18 // Define business hours
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, LogonType, LoginHour
