Service Account Password Changes

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006) / Privilege Escalation (TA0004)

MITRE Techniques:
Valid Accounts (T1078): Unauthorized password changes may indicate compromised accounts.

Detection Logic:
Monitor directory service logs for password changes on service accounts.
Alert on password changes initiated by non-administrative users or at odd times.
Correlate with login attempts and privilege escalation events.

MS Sentinel:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4724 // Password reset event
| where AccountType == "ServiceAccount"
| summarize PasswordChangeCount = count() by AccountName, Initiator, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, Initiator, PasswordChangeCount
