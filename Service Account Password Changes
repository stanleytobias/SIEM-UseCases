Service Account Password Changes

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006) / Privilege Escalation (TA0004)

MITRE Techniques:
Valid Accounts (T1078): Unauthorized password changes may indicate compromised accounts.

Detection Logic:
Monitor directory service logs for password changes on service accounts.
Alert on password changes initiated by non-administrative users or at odd times.
Correlate with login attempts and privilege escalation events.
