High Latency in Database Queries

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Data Manipulation (T1565)

Detection Logic:
Identify queries with high execution time.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
DatabaseQueryLogs
| where QueryExecutionTime > 5000 // Time in milliseconds
| summarize QueryCount = count() by User, DatabaseName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, User, DatabaseName, QueryExecutionTime

Testing:
Execute complex queries on a test database to simulate latency.
