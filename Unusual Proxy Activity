Unusual Proxy Activity

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
Technique: Use Alternate Authentication Material (T1550.003)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for spikes or anomalies in proxy usage.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
ProxyLogs
| summarize TotalRequests = count() by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TotalRequests > 1000
| project TimeGenerated, User, TotalRequests

Testing:
Generate high traffic through a proxy in a test environment.
