Unusual Patterns in Backup Activity

MITRE Tactic:
Impact (TA0040) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Data Destruction (T1485): Unusual backup patterns may precede destructive attacks.
Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486): Abnormal backups might be used as ransomware preparation.

Detection Logic:
Track backup job schedules and alert on unscheduled or excessive jobs.
Detect unusual file selections or destinations for backups.
Correlate with recent privilege escalation or unauthorized access events.

MS Sentinel:

| summarize BackupCount = count() by User, BackupType, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where BackupCount > 5 // Adjust threshold based on backup frequency
| project TimeGenerated, User, BackupType, BackupCount
