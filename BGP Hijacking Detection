BGP Hijacking Detection

MITRE Tactic:
Impact (TA0040) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Network Infrastructure Manipulation (T1583.004): BGP hijacking disrupts routing to intercept or redirect traffic.

Detection Logic:
Monitor network routing tables for unauthorized changes to prefixes or AS numbers.
Alert on traffic rerouted to unfamiliar AS paths or suspicious geolocations.
Correlate with external route monitoring systems like RIPE or BGPMon.
