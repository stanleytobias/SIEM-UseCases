MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Application Layer Protocol (T1071.004)

Detection Logic:
Detect DNS queries to known dynamic DNS (DDNS) services.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
DNSLogs
| where QueryName contains_any ("no-ip.com", "dyn.com", "duckdns.org")
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, QueryName

Testing:
