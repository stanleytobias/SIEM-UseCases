Anomalous Outbound Traffic

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048): Unexpected outbound traffic may indicate exfiltration.
C2 Communication over Web Protocols (T1071.001): Anomalous outbound traffic may suggest malicious communication.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for traffic spikes or connections to rare or suspicious IPs/domains.
Detect traffic patterns deviating from normal baselines (e.g., unusual ports, protocols).
Alert on traffic to geolocations with no business relevance.
