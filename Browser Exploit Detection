Browser Exploit Detection

MITRE Tactic:
Execution (TA0002) / Initial Access (TA0001)

MITRE Techniques:
Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203): Exploiting browser vulnerabilities to execute malicious code.

Detection Logic:
Monitor endpoint logs for unexpected browser crashes or memory access violations.
Detect unusual browser extensions or unauthorized script execution.
Use EDR solutions to analyze process injection or child process creation by browsers.

MS Sentinel:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4688 // Process creation events
| where CommandLine contains "browser.exe" and CommandLine contains "exploit"
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, ProcessName, CommandLine, User
