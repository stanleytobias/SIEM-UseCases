Account Lockout Frequency

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006) / Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Brute Force (T1110): Account lockouts may occur due to repeated brute force attempts.
Account Manipulation (T1098): Malicious activity triggering account lockouts as part of an evasion strategy.

Detection Logic:
Monitor the number of account lockouts per user in a given time frame.
Correlate failed login attempts from specific IPs or geolocations leading to lockouts.
Alert on a threshold of lockouts within a short period for multiple accounts.
