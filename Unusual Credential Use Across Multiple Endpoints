Unusual Credential Use Across Multiple Endpoints

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Lateral Movement (TA0008)
Technique: Valid Accounts (T1078)

Detection Logic:
Detect the use of the same credentials on multiple endpoints within a short period.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
AuthenticationLogs
| summarize EndpointCount = dcount(DeviceName) by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where EndpointCount > 5
| project TimeGenerated, User, EndpointCount

Testing:
Authenticate on multiple endpoints using the same test credentials.
