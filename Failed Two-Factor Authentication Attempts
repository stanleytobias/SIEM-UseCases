Failed Two-Factor Authentication Attempts

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Multi-Factor Authentication Interception (T1111)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for failed 2FA attempts in authentication logs.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
AuthenticationLogs
| where ResultType == "Failure" and AuthenticationMethod == "MFA"
| summarize Failed2FAAttempts = count() by UserPrincipalName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where Failed2FAAttempts > 3 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, Failed2FAAttempts

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Attempt 2FA with incorrect codes from a monitored test account.
