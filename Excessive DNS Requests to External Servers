Excessive DNS Requests to External Servers

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: DNS Communication Channels (T1071.004)

Detection Logic:
Detect large volumes of DNS requests to external or unknown domains.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
DNSLogs
| summarize DNSRequestCount = count() by ClientIP, QueryName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where DNSRequestCount > 100 // Adjust threshold for anomalies
| project TimeGenerated, ClientIP, QueryName, DNSRequestCount

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Use nslookup to query multiple external domains in rapid succession.
