MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Brute Force (T1110)

Detection Logic:
Detect repeated failed login attempts.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625 // Failed login
| summarize FailedLoginCount = count() by AccountName, SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailedLoginCount > 10 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, SourceIP, FailedLoginCount

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Attempt multiple failed logins using incorrect credentials.
