Endpoint Beaconing to Non-Standard Port

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Non-Standard Port (T1571)

Detection Logic:
Detect frequent outbound traffic to uncommon ports.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:

NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationPort !in (80, 443, 22)
| summarize BeaconingFrequency = count() by SourceIP, DestinationIP, DestinationPort, bin(TimeGenerated, 1m)
| where BeaconingFrequency > 10 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, DestinationPort, BeaconingFrequency

Testing:
Atomic Red Team:
Test case: T1571.
Simplest Test:
Simulate traffic using curl or similar tools to non-standard ports.
