Misuse of Multi-Factor Authentication Tokens

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Multi-Factor Authentication Interception (T1111)

Detection Logic:
Detect reuse or interception of MFA tokens.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
AuthenticationLogs
| where AuthenticationMethod == "MFA" and ResultType == "Failure"
| summarize FailureCount = count() by UserPrincipalName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailureCount > 3
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, FailureCount

Testing:
Simulate failed MFA token use from a monitored account.
