Unusual Deviation in Network Baselines

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Application Layer Protocol (T1071)

Detection Logic:
Detect significant deviations from historical network traffic baselines.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| summarize TotalBytes = sum(BytesTransferred) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| join kind=leftanti (HistoricalNetworkBaselines) on TotalBytes
| project TimeGenerated, TotalBytes

Testing:
Generate anomalous traffic patterns in a test environment.
