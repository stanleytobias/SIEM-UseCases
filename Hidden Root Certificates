Hidden Root Certificates

MITRE Tactic:
Defense Evasion (TA0005)

MITRE Techniques:
Rootkit Detection (T1014): Hidden root certificates can evade monitoring or facilitate MITM attacks.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for unauthorized root certificate installations in certificate stores.
Compare certificate issuance logs against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
Alert on certificates with unusual attributes (e.g., self-signed, expired).

MS Sentinel:
CertificateEvents
| where EventType == "CertificateInstalled"
| where CertificateThumbprint !in (trustedCertificateThumbprints) // Replace with trusted certificates
| project TimeGenerated, CertificateThumbprint, Issuer, Subject, User
