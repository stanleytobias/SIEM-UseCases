Cloud API Calls

MITRE Tactic:
Execution (TA0002) / Credential Access (TA0006)

MITRE Techniques:
Exploitation of Cloud APIs (T1587.002): Unauthorized or unusual API calls to exploit cloud services.
Cloud Service Discovery (T1580): Unusual API calls may indicate reconnaissance activity.

Detection Logic:
Monitor cloud provider API audit logs for rare or anomalous API calls.
Detect calls to high-privilege or sensitive APIs outside of normal patterns.
Use baselines for normal API activity per user and alert on deviations.
