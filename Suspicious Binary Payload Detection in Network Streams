Suspicious Binary Payload Detection in Network Streams

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Exfiltration Over Network Medium (T1048)

Detection Logic:
Monitor network streams for binary payloads in unexpected protocols.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol in ("HTTP", "DNS") and Payload contains_binary_pattern "MZ" // Binary pattern for executables
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, Payload

Testing:
Send a binary file over HTTP or DNS in a test environment.
