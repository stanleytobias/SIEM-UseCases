Port Scanning Activity

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Discovery (TA0007)
Technique: Network Service Scanning (T1046)

Detection Logic:
Detect multiple connection attempts to a wide range of ports.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| summarize ConnectionAttempts = count() by SourceIP, DestinationPort, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ConnectionAttempts > 50 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationPort, ConnectionAttempts

Testing:
Use nmap to perform a port scan on a test network.
