Unusual Network Traffic

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Application Layer Protocol (T1071)

Detection Logic:
Monitor spikes or anomalies in network traffic volumes or patterns.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| summarize TotalBytes = sum(BytesTransferred) by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TotalBytes > 1000000000
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, TotalBytes

Testing:
Generate high volumes of network traffic in a test environment.
