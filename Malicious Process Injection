Malicious Process Injection

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
Technique: Process Injection (T1055)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for signs of process injection, such as suspicious WriteProcessMemory API calls.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
ProcessCreationEvents
| where CommandLine contains "WriteProcessMemory" or CommandLine contains "VirtualAllocEx"
| project TimeGenerated, ProcessName, CommandLine, User

Testing:
Use a benign process injection tool in a controlled test environment.
