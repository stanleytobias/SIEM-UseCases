Unusual Traffic on Non-Standard Ports

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Application Layer Protocol (T1071.001)

Detection Logic:
Detect traffic on ports not commonly used.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationPort not in (80, 443, 22, 25) and BytesTransferred > 1000000
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, DestinationPort, BytesTransferred

Testing:
Send traffic over uncommon ports using tools like netcat.
