High Volume of Access Requests to Privileged Directories

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Brute Force (T1110)

Detection Logic:
Detect a high number of requests to privileged directories.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileAuditLogs
| where FilePath startswith "/admin" or FilePath startswith "/root"
| summarize AccessCount = count() by User, FilePath, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where AccessCount > 30 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, FilePath, AccessCount

Testing:
Attempt access to privileged directories using scripts.
