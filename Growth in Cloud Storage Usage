Growth in Cloud Storage Usage

MITRE Tactic:
Collection (TA0009) / Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Data Transfer to Cloud Accounts (T1567.002): Large or rapid data uploads to cloud storage may indicate exfiltration.
Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567.001): Abnormal growth could signal unauthorized exfiltration.

Detection Logic:
Monitor cloud storage metrics for sudden spikes in usage.
Correlate growth with specific users, IPs, or unusual file uploads.
Set thresholds for storage usage growth over a defined period and alert on breaches.

MS Sentinel:
AzureDiagnostics
| where Category == "Storage"
| summarize TotalDataTransferred = sum(DataTransferredMB) by AccountName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TotalDataTransferred > 1000 // Adjust threshold for abnormal growth
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, TotalDataTransferred
