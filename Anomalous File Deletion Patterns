Anomalous File Deletion Patterns

MITRE Tactic:
Defense Evasion (TA0005) / Impact (TA0040)

MITRE Techniques:
Indicator Removal on Host (T1070): Malicious actors may delete files to cover their tracks.
Data Destruction (T1485): File deletion patterns may indicate destructive behavior.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for bulk file deletions or deletion of critical system files.
Correlate deletions with recent user or process activity, such as privilege escalation.
Detect unauthorized attempts to delete logs or security-related files.
