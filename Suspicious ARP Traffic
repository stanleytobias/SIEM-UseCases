Suspicious ARP Traffic

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: ARP Cache Poisoning (T1557.002)

Detection Logic:
Detect abnormal ARP traffic, such as high volumes of requests.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Protocol == "ARP"
| summarize ARPCount = count() by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ARPCount > 100 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, ARPCount

Testing:
Simulate high ARP traffic using tools like hping3.
