Unusual Bandwidth Consumption

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Exfiltration Over Network Medium (T1048)

Detection Logic:
Detect spikes in network bandwidth consumption that deviate from the baseline.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| summarize TotalBytes = sum(BytesTransferred) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), SourceIP
| where TotalBytes > 1000000000
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, TotalBytes

Testing:
Transfer large amounts of data over the network in a controlled environment.
