DNS Tunneling Detection

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048.003)

Detection Logic:
Detect large amounts of DNS traffic with encoded payloads or unusually long DNS queries.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
DNSLogs
| where strlen(QueryName) > 100 // Adjust threshold for long queries
| summarize QueryCount = count() by ClientIP, QueryName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, ClientIP, QueryName, QueryCount

Testing:
Atomic Red Team:
Test case: T1048.003 https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1048.003/T1048.003.yaml
Simulate DNS tunneling.

Simplest Test:
Use a DNS tunneling tool such as dnscat2.
