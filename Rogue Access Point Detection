Rogue Access Point Detection

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
Technique: Network Service Manipulation (T1570)

Detection Logic:
Detect unauthorized access points in the network.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationIP not in (authorizedAccessPoints)
| summarize ConnectionCount = count() by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, ConnectionCount

Testing:
Introduce a rogue access point and monitor connections.
