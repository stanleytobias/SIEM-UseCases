Data Exfiltration Detection

MITRE Tactic:
Exfiltration (TA0010)

MITRE Techniques:
Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567.001): Exfiltration through legitimate web services.
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048): Using non-standard protocols for exfiltration.

Detection Logic:
Monitor outbound traffic for large or unusual data transfers.
Detect connections to unauthorized external hosts or flagged cloud storage services.
Correlate with file access logs to identify potential staging activities.

MS Sentinel:
NetworkTraffic
| where Direction == "Outbound"
| summarize TotalDataTransferred = sum(BytesSent) by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TotalDataTransferred > 1000000000 // Adjust threshold for exfiltration volume
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, TotalDataTransferred
