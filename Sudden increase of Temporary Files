Sudden increase of Temporary Files

MITRE Tactic:
Persistence (TA0003) / Impact (TA0040)

MITRE Techniques:
Temporary File Creation (T1074): Abnormal file growth could indicate malware staging or data collection.
Disk Wipe (T1561): Temporary files may be used as part of destructive operations.

Detection Logic:
Monitor filesystem events for high rates of temporary file creation.
Compare against baseline activity for the specific system or user.
Alert on excessive growth in directories like /tmp or %TEMP%.
