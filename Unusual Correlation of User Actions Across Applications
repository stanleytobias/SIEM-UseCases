Unusual Correlation of User Actions Across Applications

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Discovery (TA0007)
Technique: Account Discovery (T1087)

Detection Logic:
Monitor for unusual user activity across multiple applications in short intervals.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
union AppActivityLogs, AuthenticationLogs
| summarize ActionCount = count() by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ActionCount > threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, ActionCount

Testing:
Perform a series of activities in multiple applications using a test account.
