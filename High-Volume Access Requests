High-Volume Access Requests

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Brute Force (T1110)

Detection Logic:
Detect multiple access attempts to sensitive resources.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
AccessLogs
| summarize AccessCount = count() by User, Resource, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where AccessCount > 100 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, Resource, AccessCount

Testing:
Use a script to request access to sensitive resources repeatedly.
