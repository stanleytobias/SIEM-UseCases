Excessive File Access by a Single User

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Collection (TA0009)
Technique: Data Staged (T1074)

Detection Logic:
Detect unusually high file access rates by a single user.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
FileAuditLogs
| where ActionType == "Read"
| summarize FileAccessCount = count() by User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FileAccessCount > 100 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, User, FileAccessCount

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Use a script to read multiple files in rapid succession.
