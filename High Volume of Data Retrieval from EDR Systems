High Volume of Data Retrieval from EDR Systems

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Collection (TA0009)
Technique: Data Staged (T1074)

Detection Logic:
Detect excessive API calls or data extraction from endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
APIActivityLogs
| where ResourceType == "EDR"
| summarize DataRetrievalCount = count() by CallerIP, User, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where DataRetrievalCount > 50 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, CallerIP, User, DataRetrievalCount

Testing:
Use a script to extract data from an EDR system's API in a test environment.
