Insider Threat Data Exfiltration

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
Technique: Data Transfer to External Accounts (T1567)

Detection Logic:
Detect unusual data transfers by internal users to external accounts or servers.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationIP !in (internalNetworkIPs)
| summarize DataTransferred = sum(BytesSent) by User, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where DataTransferred > 100000000 // Adjust threshold in bytes
| project TimeGenerated, User, DestinationIP, DataTransferred

Testing:
Transfer large amounts of data to an external test server.
