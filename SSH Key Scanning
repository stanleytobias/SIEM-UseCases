SSH Key Scanning

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006) / Discovery (TA0007)

MITRE Techniques:
SSH Hijacking (T1563.001): Scanning for SSH keys to gain unauthorized access.
Private Keys (T1552.004): Attempts to locate and misuse private keys.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for excessive file read operations targeting .ssh directories.
Detect repeated access attempts to private keys by unusual processes or users.
Correlate with failed login attempts or privilege escalation activities.

MS Sentinel:
FileAccessEvents
| where FilePath contains "/.ssh/"
| summarize AccessCount = count() by User, FilePath, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where AccessCount > 10 // Adjust threshold for scanning behavior
| project TimeGenerated, User, FilePath, AccessCount
