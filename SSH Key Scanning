SSH Key Scanning

MITRE Tactic:
Credential Access (TA0006) / Discovery (TA0007)

MITRE Techniques:
SSH Hijacking (T1563.001): Scanning for SSH keys to gain unauthorized access.
Private Keys (T1552.004): Attempts to locate and misuse private keys.

Detection Logic:
Monitor for excessive file read operations targeting .ssh directories.
Detect repeated access attempts to private keys by unusual processes or users.
Correlate with failed login attempts or privilege escalation activities.
