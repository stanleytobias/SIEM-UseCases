Sudden Increase in Failed API Requests

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Technique: Application API Abuse (T1529)

Detection Logic:
Monitor API logs for a surge in failed requests.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
APIActivityLogs
| where Status == "Failed"
| summarize FailedRequestCount = count() by CallerIP, APIName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailedRequestCount > 50 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, CallerIP, APIName, FailedRequestCount

Testing:
Send multiple invalid API requests from a test account.
