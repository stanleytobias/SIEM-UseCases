Elevated Error Rates in Application Logs

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Resource Hijacking (T1496)

Detection Logic:
Detect surges in error logs, such as HTTP 500 errors or database query failures.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
AppLogs
| where SeverityLevel == "Error"
| summarize ErrorCount = count() by ApplicationName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ErrorCount > 50 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, ApplicationName, ErrorCount

Testing:
Simplest Test:
Trigger errors in the application by submitting invalid input or requests.
