Abuse of Group Policy Objects (GPO)

MITRE Tactic:
Defense Evasion (TA0005) / Privilege Escalation (TA0004)

MITRE Techniques:
System Binary Proxy Execution (T1218): Abuse of GPOs to execute unauthorized binaries.
Modify Cloud Access Policies (T1484.002): Misusing GPO to escalate privileges or evade detection.

Detection Logic:
Monitor Active Directory logs for GPO modifications.
Alert on changes made by unauthorized users or outside scheduled changes.
Correlate with privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.

MS Sentinel:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 5136 // Directory service changes
| where ObjectClass == "groupPolicyContainer"
| summarize ChangeCount = count() by AccountName, ObjectName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ChangeCount > 3 // Adjust threshold based on expected changes
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, ObjectName, ChangeCount
