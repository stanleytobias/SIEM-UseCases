Traffic to Rare Domains

MITRE Tactic:
Command and Control (TA0011) / Initial Access (TA0001)

MITRE Techniques:
Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) (T1568.002): Rare domains may be associated with malicious DGA traffic.
DNS Tunneling (T1071.004): Rare domains may indicate DNS-based C2 channels.

Detection Logic:
Analyze DNS logs for domains with low frequency of appearance across the network.
Alert on domains newly registered or flagged in threat intelligence feeds.
Correlate rare domains with other suspicious traffic (e.g., non-standard ports).

MS Sentinel:
DNSLogs
| summarize QueryCount = count() by DomainName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where QueryCount == 1 // Rare domain with a single query
| project TimeGenerated, DomainName, QueryCount
