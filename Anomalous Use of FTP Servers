Anomalous Use of FTP Servers

MITRE Tactic:
Exfiltration (TA0010) / Command and Control (TA0011)

MITRE Techniques:
Exfiltration Over FTP (T1048.002): Suspicious FTP usage may signal data exfiltration.

Detection Logic:
Monitor FTP server logs for unauthorized access attempts or unusual activity.
Detect large file uploads/downloads or connections from rare IPs.
Alert on non-standard FTP commands or high-frequency requests.

MS Sentinel:
NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationPort == 21
| summarize FTPActivityCount = count() by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FTPActivityCount > 10 // Adjust threshold based on environment
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, FTPActivityCount
