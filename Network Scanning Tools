Network Scanning Tools

MITRE Tactic:
Discovery (TA0007)

MITRE Techniques:
Network Service Scanning (T1046): Tools like Nmap or masscan may be used for reconnaissance.

Detection Logic:
Monitor network traffic for port scans or sweeps (e.g., high connection attempts across multiple ports).
Detect patterns of SYN/ACK responses from multiple devices.
Alert on known scanning tools or scripts initiated from endpoints.

MS Sentinel:
NetworkTraffic
| where DestinationPort in (dynamic(range(1, 65535, 1))) // Ports in scanning range
| summarize ScanAttempts = count() by SourceIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ScanAttempts > 500 // Adjust threshold for scanning behavior
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, ScanAttempts
