Unusual Delays in Network Packet Delivery

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Impact (TA0040)
Technique: Network Denial of Service (T1498)

Detection Logic:
Detect delays in network packet delivery exceeding normal baselines.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where Latency > 1000
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, Latency

Testing:
Introduce latency into the network using tools like tc in a controlled environment.
