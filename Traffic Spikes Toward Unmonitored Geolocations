Traffic Spikes Toward Unmonitored Geolocations

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
Tactic: Command and Control (TA0011)
Technique: Proxy (T1090.003)

Detection Logic:
Detect traffic spikes to IPs in unmonitored or unusual geolocations.

Microsoft Sentinel KQL Query:
NetworkTraffic
| where GeoLocation not in (monitoredGeolocations)
| summarize TrafficVolume = sum(BytesTransferred) by GeoLocation, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TrafficVolume > 100000000 // Adjust threshold
| project TimeGenerated, GeoLocation, TrafficVolume

Testing:
Generate test traffic to an IP in an unmonitored geolocation.
